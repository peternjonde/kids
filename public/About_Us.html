            <p> We are class of 2025 university students at Western university in the software engineering program and computer science program respectively. We created Kidz Learn Code with the goal to teach kids the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving, that will help them in any future endeavor that they may encounter in the future may that be in tech or not. Looking back now we wished we had the opportunity to learn about programming/coding to give us an advantage in the future and just improve our critical thinking skills. In short, we are just trying to help young boys and girls be their best self.
